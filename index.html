      <h1>A first step into the world of programming languages.</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Over the past month(ish), I’ve been working on a project I’ve always
        dreamed of undertaking: creating my own programming language.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        If you’re interested in seeing the code for yourself, check it out
        <a href="https://github.com/Sam-Hobson/broccoli" target="_blank">here</a
        >!
      </div>
      <h2>Where to start</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Knowing where to start is often the most intimidating part of creating a
        language, so I’ll go through some of the initial decisions and steps
        taken towards beginning such a project.
      </div>
      <h2>Why are you making a language?</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        This it the first essential question to ask! Are you making a language
        for fun? To learn? Is your language meant to fulfill an untouched niche?
        Whatever the reason, its vital to consider what is important to your
        language.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I’m making a language to learn, and play with experimental language
        features like time complexity prediction, post-processed function
        impurity, or strongly typed function side-effects. As we go, I’ll
        explain how this plan impacts the decisions I make at each stage of the
        process.
      </div>
      <h2>Compiled, or interpreted?</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        There are two main ways to turn code into action, compiling and
        interpreting:
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="paragraph">
            A compiler runs through the program code, figures out what it is
            doing, and then converts that code into "machine code". This file of
            machine code can then be executed very quickly by a computer
            whenever it needs to run the program.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="paragraph">
            An interpreter on the other hand will step through code line by
            line, figuring out what the code is doing as it goes.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Here’s a good analogy about compilers and interpreters I've read:
        <div class="quote">
          A compiler will read a recipe in a cookbook, and translate it into
          explicit instructions for your kitchen: "Turn the stove to 180°C, then
          turn left 45° and open the drawer"...
          <div class="paragraph">
            An interpreter on the other hand will read you each line of the
            recipe one by one, and wait for you to tell it to move onto the next
            line. This makes it a lot less bossy, but also leaves you a lot of
            room to make mistakes if you’re not careful!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="paragraph">
        Generally, interpreting tends to be more flexible, while compiling tends
        to have higher performance. But this is only scratching the surface of a
        very complex topic.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Since I’m creating this language for the purpose of learning and
        experimentation, I’m not too concerned with performance, so I’ll stick
        with an interpreter for now.
      </div>
      <h2>Choosing a language, for your language</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Every application, even compilers and interpreters are built with some
        programming language, and the one you choose will play a huge role in
        the development of your language.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        If you’re creating a compiled language, the most important thing to
        consider is how comfortable you are with the language you choose! At the
        end of day, a few more seconds of waiting to compile millions of lines
        of code isn’t a big price to pay.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        However, the story is very different with interpreters. Because an
        interpreter will directly run your code instead of creating an optimised
        file of machine code, the interpreter being slow means your language is
        slow.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I'd recommend using C, C++, or any other performant language for an
        interpreter. Alternatively, functional languages are often very well
        suited for parsing, and are convenient to build with, however their
        immutability makes them incredibly inefficient interpreting
        non-functional languages.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        As I’ve mentioned before, I’m not worried about the speed of my
        language, but am more focussed on creating a language which is easy to
        experiment with. So the functional language Haskell suits my needs well.
      </div>
      <h2>Design overview</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        A programming language goes through several different stages before we
        see our final result. Each stage will add an extra layer of meaning to
        the data, starting by identifying key operations, and then building an
        order operations, but we will get more into these ideas as we go...
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        This is an illustration of the processes we will cover, right up to
        interpreting:
