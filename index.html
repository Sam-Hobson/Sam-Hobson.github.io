      <h1>A first step into the world of programming languages.</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Over the past month(ish), I’ve been working on a project I’ve always dreamed of undertaking: creating my own programming language.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
          If you’re interested in seeing the code for yourself, check it out
      <a href="https://github.com/Sam-Hobson/broccoli" target="_blank">here</a>!
      </div>
      <h2>Getting started</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Knowing where to start is often the most intimidating part of creating a language, so I’ll go through some of the initial decisions and steps taken towards starting a new language.
      </div>
      <h2>Will our language be compiled, or interpreted?</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">There are two main ways to turn code into action, compiling and interpreting:</div>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <div class="paragraph">
            A compiler runs through the program code, figures out what it is doing, and then converts that code into "machine code".
            This file of machine code can then be executed very quickly by a computer whenever it needs to run the program.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <div class="paragraph">
            An interpreter on the other hand will step through code line by line, figuring out what the code is doing as it goes.
          </div>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="paragraph">Here’s a good analogy about compilers and interpreters I've read:
        <div class="quote">
          A compiler will read a recipe in a cookbook, and translate it into explicit instructions for your kitchen: 
          "Turn the stove to 180°C, then turn left 45° and open the drawer"...
          <div class="paragraph">
            An interpreter on the other hand will read you each line of the recipe one by one, 
            and wait for you to tell it to move onto the next line. This makes it a lot less bossy, 
            but also leaves you a lot of room to make mistakes if you’re not careful!
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Generally, interpreting tends to be more flexible, while compiling tends to have higher performance. 
        But this is only scratching the surface of a very complex topic.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Since I’m creating this language for the purpose of learning and experimentation, I’m not too concerned with performance,
        so I’ll stick with an interpreter for now.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        This is the first very important decision to make when creating a language because a lot of what comes next is affected by it!
      </div>
      <h2>Choosing a language, for your language</h2>
      <div class="paragraph">
        Every application, even compilers and interpreters are built with some programming language,
        and the one you choose will play a huge role in the development of your language.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        If you’re creating a compiled language, 
        the most important thing to consider is how comfortable you are with the language you choose!
        At the end of day, a few more seconds of waiting to compile millions of lines of code isn’t a big price to pay.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        However, the story is very different with interpreters. 
        Because an interpreter will directly run your code instead of creating an optimised file of machine code, 
        the interpreter being slow means your language is slow.
      </div>
      <div class="paragraph">
        I'd recommend using C, C++, or any other performant language for an interpreter.
        Alternatively, functional languages are often very well suited for parsing, and are convenient to build with, 
        however their immutability makes them incredibly inefficient interpreting languages.
